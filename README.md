# youMusicDownloader
Python GUI for a youtube songs downloader. 

The code is partially mine, and partially not mine, do whatever you want with it, hope you upgrade it (it is not difficult).

At the first start you need to copy-paste a code given by the software into a url and then login with you youtube account.
## pip package that you need:
*PySimpleGUI*, *pytube*, *pillow*

`pip install pysimplegui`, `pip install pytube`, `pip install pillow`

## Alert:
The code is now under construction, for **the right one look at the release and download it from there**
